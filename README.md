# Active-Information-Gathering
# Description:
# This script automates some Active Information processes and compiles the data into files. 

# Usage:
# The client will be prompted for an IP address for the tools to run against. This IP address is
# saved to a variable and this variable is used in commands. Recommend running wireshark at the same 
# time for deeper insight into network traffic between host and target.
